# IBridgePy
-----------------------------------------------------
If you want to have a quick start, please go to folder simple_examples
You will find 3 examples in the folder:

        Request_historical_data.py
You can use this code to request historical data from IB, following IB’s restrictions.

        Request_real_time_quotes.py
You can use this code to request real time quotes from IB as long as you have the permission from IB to request. You may need to pay month fee to purchase real time data. IB’s pricing is very competitive.

        Place_order.py
This one is to place a market order or a limit order to buy/sell some shares of a security. The coding allows you to purchase stock, forex and futures.

To run these simple examples, you can just run the file as long as you have added the IBridgePy local folder to the PYTHONPATH.
