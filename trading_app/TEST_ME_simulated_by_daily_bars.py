# The backtesting time period is defined by two variables: endTime and startTime, default timezone = 'US/Eastern'
####

# As a demo, endTime is Dec 24th 2020 because the ingested historical data ends on that date.
# IBridgePy automatically sets endTime.second to 0 because the default mode of IBridgePy backtester is designed to
# backtest strategies minutely and the second must be zero.
endTime = dt.datetime(2020, 12, 24)

# As a demo, startTime is 50 days ago from the current time.
startTime = endTime - dt.timedelta(days=50)

# "histIngestionPlan" is a reserved word in IBridgePy to store the historical data ingestion plan that describes what historical data
# are needed during backtesting and IBridgePy backtester will fetch these data before backtesting to speed up the whole backtesting process.
# "histIngestionPlan" is not required for backtesting but it will make backtest much faster.
# "histIngestionPlan" is an instance of HistIngestionPlan.

# dataSourceName='simulatedByDailyBars' means to simulate minute bar data by daily bar data when it is needed.
